Library project
# The Artemis Bookshelf

A personal book journal web application that lets you catalog and reflect on books you've read, write reviews, rate books, and collect favorite quotes in a cozy, visually calm interface. 

The project is built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and PostgreSQL (database file included).

To run it, install Node.js, download or clone the project, navigate to the folder in your terminal, run `npm install` to install dependencies, and `npm start` to launch the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). All necessary dependencies are listed in `package.json`, and the included database file allows the app to function immediately.
